🚀 Introducing SubSearch AI: An Advanced Subtitle Search Engine Powered by NLP & ML 🎥

🌟 Objective: In the rapidly growing world of digital content, accessing relevant information from video subtitles is a challenge. To address this, I’ve developed SubSearch AI, an advanced search engine designed to efficiently retrieve subtitles based on user queries.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ NLP-Powered Search: Leverages natural language processing to understand query intent and retrieve the most relevant subtitle segments.
✅ ML-Based Similarity Matching: Uses Sentence Transformers for semantic similarity, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant results.
✅ Real-Time Audio Query: Converts user audio queries to text using Vosk ASR and retrieves matching subtitles instantly.
✅ Streamlined Search Experience: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and interactive user experience.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python (Streamlit, Pandas, ChromaDB, Vosk)
Machine Learning: Sentence Transformers for semantic similarity
Database: SQLite for storing and retrieving subtitle content
💡 This project showcases the power of NLP and ML in enhancing video content accessibility and search relevance.
